# Emotion_Detection_System
The Emotion Detection System using Facial Features is a deep learning-based project that leverages Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to recognize and classify emotions from facial expressions. This system can analyze images or video streams in real-time, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from enhancing user experiences in human-computer interaction to monitoring emotional states in various contexts.

## Key Features
1. Real-time Emotion Analysis:
Detect and classify emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, in real-time from live video streams or images.
2. Robust Performance:
Utilizes deep learning models and advanced computer vision techniques to achieve high accuracy in emotion recognition.

## How it Works
The system uses a deep neural network that I have trained to extract facial features and classify emotions. It leverages the power of TensorFlow for deep learning and OpenCV for real-time video processing. The trained model can accurately predict emotions from facial expressions, making it suitable for applications such as mood-aware user interfaces, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the open-source community and the developers behind TensorFlow and OpenCV for making this project possible.
